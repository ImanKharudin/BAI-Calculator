#### What is BAI?

**Body Adiposity Index (BAI)** is used to check your body fat level based on the size of your hips and your height. Unlike BMI, it doesn't use your body weight for estimations. Several studies show that this method is equal to the body fat percentage of adult men and women. 

#### Calculating the BAI
Calculating the body adiposity index, divide your hip circumference (cm) by your height (m) raised to the power of 1.5, and then subtract 18 as follows:

> BAI = (cm/m^1.5) - 18

where *cm* represents the person's hip circumference and *m^1.5* the person's height powered to 1.5

#### About this BAI Calculator

This *BAI Calculator* is for adults 20 years and older. Further information on calculating BMI for children and teenagers is available from the CDC [1].
